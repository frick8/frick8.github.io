                <p>Hello! I'm a passionate Roblox developer with years of experience creating immersive and engaging game experiences. I specialize in modular code design and am proficient with tools like Rojo and VSCode. My journey into the world of Roblox development began as a gray hatter, where I honed my skills and landed my first job working with Quenty on WFYB. Since then, I've contributed to several games, including Hero Quest, and have a proven track record of developing robust systems for many different things. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and explore new technologies to push the boundaries of game development.</p>
