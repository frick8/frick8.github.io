                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello! I'm a passionate Roblox developer with years of experience creating immersive and engaging game experiences. I specialize in modular code design and am proficient with tools like Rojo and VSCode. My journey into the world of collaborative Roblox development began as a gray hatter, where I honed my skills and landed my first job working with Quenty on WFYB, a game with 65M+ visits and 700k+ favorites. Since then, I've contributed to several games, including Hero Quest, and have a proven track record of developing robust systems for many different things. I've invested 1000+ hours on optimizing game performance, reducing load times, and creating the cleanest most efficient code I can. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and explore new technologies to push the boundaries of game development.</p>

                <h1>Knowledge</h1>
                <p>I have been learning for 4+ years, originally started programming on roblox in 2019 when I found interest in creating a modded miners haven game using the open sourced template for the game. Since then I have gotten much better at what I do and can confidently say I have mastered luau/programming on roblox. Programming in general has always been fun for me, I took AP computer science in highschool and am now pursuing a degree in software engineering. Working on learning different languages is something I do in my free time, currently C++ is my main target which has been going well. I find it easy to partially understand new languages, especially interpreted ones similar to lua, such as JS and Python, which I have used in multiple projects. I am familiar Atlassian tools like Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, which were all used in the creation of Hero Quest. I think it's important to collaborate with co-workers and am willing to provide mentoring if necessary to improve workflow and make the work environment a better place for everyone.</p>
